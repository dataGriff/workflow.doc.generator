**State:** Doing.

**Objective:**  
**Help Hungovercoders Bond with Super Socialisation**  
It has been noted that hungovercoder account closure has been due to the lack of social connections in the physical world.  
We want to stop this decline and help hungovercoders more easily get together to increase those social bonds!

**Key Results:**

- Two hungovercoder technical meetups in Cardiff by the end of September 2025.
- One hungovercoder mega party in Cardiff by the end of October 2025.

**Method of Measure:**

- We will use [this](www.google.co.uk) meetup report to measure the number of social events that occur, as demonstrated by the bar chart on page1.

**Objective Outcome:**

- Pending.

### Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis:** If we create a Local Pub Finding Application for the hungovercoders community then they will arrange a date for the mega party.  
  This will help us achieve the key result of having one mega party by the end of October 2025.
